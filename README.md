DeFi-Wage is a decentralized payroll system that runs on ZK Scroll Sepolia, a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, offering an innovative solution to streamline salary management for businesses and organisations. It is designed to be more efficient, secure, and cost-effective than traditional payroll systems. Using the power of Ethereum and ZK Rollups, DeFi-Wage is designed to enhance throughput, reduce costs, and provide a faster and more secure way to manage employee salaries.

## How it works

DeFi-Wage uses a smart contract to manage the payroll process. The smart contract is responsible for calculating salaries, distributing wages, and processing loans.

To get started with DefiWage, you will need to create a company account or get added by your Employer. Once you have created an account, you can add employees and set their salaries. You can also deposit funds into the contract to cover payroll expenses.

At the end of each month, the smart contract will automatically calculate salaries and distribute wages to employees. Employees can then withdraw their wages from the contract to their own wallets.
